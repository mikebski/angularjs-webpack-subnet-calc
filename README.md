# Angular js Subnet Claculator

## About

This is a simple demonstration of webpack and how to make it work with angularjs

All of the examples I could find were old, so this one is Angularjs 1.7 and Webpack 4

It also contains a basic widget for calculating network ranges give an IP/Subnet
specification such as `192.168.1.0/24` for a `24 `bit mask of the network
`192.168.1.0`
